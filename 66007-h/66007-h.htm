<h2 class="nobreak" id="WATER">WATER.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Water</span> bears a very important part in relation
to the human system and preservation of health.
It combines with the tissues of the body, and
forms a necessary part of its structure. In the
case of a man weighing one hundred and fifty-four
pounds, one hundred and eleven would consist of
water. It enters very largely into the composition
of our food. Although water is so important
a factor in our existence, and although its vitiation
often gives rise to that deadly pestilence,
typhoid fever, yet, strange to say, there are comparatively
few people who possess any trustworthy
information respecting its primary sources and
purest forms. The object of this paper will be
to afford our readers some useful hints respecting
the various kinds of water and their
relative purity, also to mention certain wise
precautions requisite in order to avoid impure
water.</p>

<p>The first great source of water is the ocean;
the sun shining upon the surface, its heating rays
combine with and send out a certain amount of
vapour. The atmosphere, like a sponge, absorbs
the vaporous water, forming clouds, which are
driven by the wind east, west, north, and
south. When the clouds arrive in a cooler
atmosphere, the vapour condenses, and descends
in the form of rain or snow, being ultimately
absorbed into the earth, giving rise to different
varieties of water; or it pours down
the mountains, and forms rivulets, and ultimately
rivers. Thus we have rain, spring, and
river water. We may here mention that Dr
Normandy discovered a process by which sea-water
can be distilled and rendered fit to drink.
In nature, water is never found perfectly pure, as
that which descends in rain is to a certain degree
contaminated by the impurities contained in the
air, as spring-water is by contact with various
substances in the earth. These impurities are
not always perceptible. Thus, the clearest and
brightest waters, those of springs and pellucid
rivers, even when filtered, are never pure. They
all contain a greater or less percentage of saline
matter, often so much so, indeed, as to form what
are termed mineral waters. Amongst the purest
natural waters hitherto discovered is that of the
Loka in North Sweden. It contains only one-twentieth
of a grain (0.0566) of mineral matter
per gallon. The water supplied to the city of
Edinburgh contains from seven to fourteen grains
in the gallon; whilst that of the Thames near
London contains about twenty-one. Rain-water,
if collected in the country, is the purest; but when
obtained in or near large cities, becomes impure
from passing through a vitiated atmosphere.</p>

<p>It is, however, on spring and river water that
we depend for our daily supply, and a due consideration
of these waters is manifestly a matter
of no small moment.</p>

<p>Well-water, as also that of some springs, especially
when obtained in or near towns, although
cool and clear, and at times sparkling, is to
be avoided. The solvent power of water being
so great, it takes up many impurities from the
soil through which it passes. In the neighbourhood
of dwellings and farmyards, the water often
is impure, and unfit to drink. Wells in the
vicinity of graveyards are particularly to be
avoided. Mr Noad found a hundred grains of
solid matter to the gallon of water taken from a
well in the vicinity of Highgate Church, London.
Besides mineral substances, decaying vegetable
impurities are usually found in wells. The
water that supplies the surface-wells of London
is derived from rain, which percolates through
the gravel and accumulates upon the clay. Now,
this gravel contains all the soakage of London
filth; through it run drains and sewers, the
surface also being riddled with innumerable
cesspools.</p>

<p>River-water being derived from the conflux of
many springs with rain-water, unless close to
large towns, is decidedly preferable to well-water;
but it is liable to a certain amount of contamination,
by holding in suspension a considerable
quantity of animal, vegetable, and earthy matters.
This, according to Dr Paris, is unquestionably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">{498}</span>
the case in water supplied from the Thames by
the Grand Junction Water Company. Be it known
that Thames water is never used in London
breweries, but Artesian-well water, brought up
from a depth of several hundred feet.</p>

<p>Besides vegetable and animal impurities in
water, there are two other substances which are
usually considered foreign to pure water—namely,
saline and mineral. The saline are often present
in such large proportions as to render water
medicinal, as illustrated by those of Cheltenham,
Leamington, and Harrogate, numerous other
varieties existing on the continent. Brighton
water, although sparkling, contains a great deal
of bi-carbonate of lime, which, being soluble,
filtering is ineffectual to remove. When boiled,
however, the carbonic acid is driven off and
the chalk precipitated. Such water when boiled
is fit for drinking purposes.</p>

<p>A simple but not infallible test for ascertaining
animal or vegetable contaminations in water is
to put fifteen or twenty drops of permanganate
of potash solutions, or Condy’s fluid, into a
tumblerful of water. If the water is free from
such impurities, the permanganate will retain
its beautiful red colour. Should the water contain
organic matter, the red hue soon disappears,
and in proportion to its contamination will be
the discoloration.</p>

<p>Bad water is far more dangerous than impure
air; the air may be dispersed by ventilation
and change of atmosphere; whilst water when
vitiated is a constant source of mischief. Snow-water
when collected in the open country equals
rain-water in purity. It has been supposed by
some to be unhealthy; but such belief is totally
unsupported by any reliable evidence. The practical
observations of Captain Cook on his voyage
round the world demonstrate beyond all question
its wholesomeness.</p>

<p>Lake-water is collected rain, spring, and occasionally
river waters. Its transparency, however,
is not to be relied on as evidence of purity. It is
often contaminated by both vegetable and animal
matter, which, owing to its stagnant nature, have
become decomposed. According to Dr Paris and
other authorities, endemic diarrhœa often arises
from drinking lake-water, a circumstance which
tourists would do well to bear in mind.</p>

<p>Should much lime be present in water, as in
that supplied by the Kent Water Company,
boiling alone will not soften it; but by the
addition of a little soda during the boiling, the
lime of the gypsum is precipitated. Marsh-water
is certainly the most impure of all water,
being loaded with decomposing vegetable matter.
Many diseases have without doubt been occasioned
by its use.</p>

<p>The receptacles in which even the purest water
is kept are of the utmost importance in a
hygienic point of view. The noted colic of
Amsterdam was believed by Tronchin—who
wrote a history of that epidemic—to have been
occasioned by leaves falling into leaden cisterns
filled with rain-water and there putrefying.
Van Sweiten also mentions an instance where a
whole family were affected with colic from a
similar cause. The acidity arising from decomposing
leaves in water dissolves part of the leaden
receptacle, and such water ofttimes thus induces
lead-colic.</p>

<p>The sources of contaminated drinking-water
are very numerous, and may affect the water at
its source, in its flow, in its reservoir, or during
distribution. When stored in houses, it is especially
exposed to risk, and this is the most
important argument in favour of constant service.
Cistern stowage lessens the risks incidental
to intermissions; but at the same time the
success of this plan entirely depends upon the
receptacle being properly made and frequently
cleansed. An eminent physician told the writer
that he believed typhoid fever often originated
from the stagnant water in dirty cisterns being
used for drinking purposes.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at the most important
part of this paper—namely, the most effectual
means for obtaining pure water.</p>

<p>For the purification of water, various methods
have from time to time been suggested, with
more or less success. Perhaps the most efficient
for attaining so desirable an end is by
passing it through layers of charcoal, a substance
eminently useful in preserving water from
corruption, by abstracting therefrom both vegetable
and animal matter. Nevertheless, where
there is reason to suspect the presence of much
injurious contamination, the process of boiling
previous to filtration should never be omitted.
The water subsequently must be agitated in
contact with the atmosphere, with a view to
the restoration of its natural proportion of air;
otherwise, it is insipid and tasteless. In China,
water is seldom drunk until it has been boiled.
According to the advice of a distinguished court
physician, those who travel on the continent
should studiously avoid drinking water, especially
that contained in the bedroom bottles of hotels.
The same authority is also of opinion that typhoid
fever is often thus caught whilst travelling.
Natural mineral waters, such as Apollinaris, are,
he considers, the best to drink whilst travelling.
Lastly, those who are desirous of drinking the
purest water should take distilled water, which
possesses the following advantages: (1) Great
purity; (2) High powers as a solvent of all
animal and vegetable substances; and (3) The
material assistance which its remarkable solvent
properties exercise in favouring a healthy digestion.
It also assists in eliminating calcareous
matter from the system; hence its undeniable
utility for vesical concretions. To those who
are unable to obtain distilled water, we would
most strongly urge the importance of boiling
all drinking-water, and then filtering through
charcoal, previous to use. The charcoal through
which water is filtered ought frequently to be
replaced by a fresh supply, as otherwise it becomes
choked up in time by impurities, which at last
escape into the water. Under such circumstances,
even filtered water may become contaminated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">{499}</span>
Were this simple precaution more generally
adopted, according to the latest teachings of
science, many a life liable to be destroyed by
typhoid fever would most assuredly be saved.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLI.—PULLED UP.</h3>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">The</span> strain is proving almost too much for
me,’ Philip wrote. ‘I have no doubt that my
scheme is practicable; and even if I fail, somebody
else will carry it out by-and-by. But at
present the men do not understand it, and are
suspicious that my promises will not be fulfilled.
So that the harder I strive to put matters right,
the more wrong they seem to go. The losses
are bringing me to a crisis, and the worry which
is the consequence of daily disappointment is
driving me out of my wits. Sleepless nights and
restless nervous days began long ago, although
I have not told you; and I have been obliged
to swallow all sorts of rubbish in the form of
narcotics. At first they gave me sleep, and that
was a gain, notwithstanding the muddled headachy
feeling they left me next day.</p>

<p>‘O yes; I have seen the doctor. Joy is a
capital fellow. He came in by accident, and
when he saw me, gave me good advice—as
usual, the advice which could not be followed.
He told me that I ought to have absolute rest
of mind and body, and to secure it, ought to
throw up everything. A good joke that—as
good as telling a soldier that he ought to run
as soon as he sees the chance of catching a bullet
in the wrong way!</p>

<p>‘Do not be afraid, though: I will take a
long rest, when I get things a little straight
here.</p>

<p>‘One of my present worries is that Kersey
has deserted—as I feared he would. Says he
is going to Australia or Manitoba, but will give
no explanation. That girl Pansy is no doubt
at the bottom of it, and I do not think even
you can set it right. If my suspicions are
correct, she is the fool of her own vanity. She
has thrown over an honest fellow, because she
is thinking of a man who has no more notion
of having anything to do with her than of
trying to jump over the moon. I am sorry
for her—especially as she deprives me of the
best man about the place.</p>

<p>‘As for Wrentham, he irritates me. He sees
my anxiety, and yet he comes and goes as gaily
as if the whole thing were a farce, which should
not disturb anybody’s equanimity, no matter how
it ended. And then he has that horrible look
of “I told you so” on his face, whenever I
attempt to make him seriously examine the
state of affairs.</p>

<p>‘The fact is I begin to repent having ever
asked for his assistance. He is much more
interested in speculative stocks than in the
business which ought to occupy his whole
attention at this juncture.</p>

<p>‘But, there—I am in a highly excited condition
at present, and no doubt misjudge him.
He does everything required willingly enough,
although not in the spirit which seems to me
necessary to the success of my plans.’</p>

<p>The letter was not finished, and so far it
did not give a full account of his sufferings
mental and physical, or of the gravity with
which Dr Joy had warned him that he must
pull up at once, or prepare for insanity or death.
The good little doctor had never before pronounced
such a decided verdict, for, with professional
discretion and natural kindliness, he
avoided a decisive prognosis unless the result
were inevitable. Philip had promised obedience
as soon as he got over the present difficulty—promised
to take whatever drugs the doctor
prescribed, and begged him in the meanwhile
not to frighten the people at Willowmere (of
course the doctor understood he meant Madge)
with any alarming reports.</p>

<p>Philip was writing in his chambers late at
night, when he was interrupted by the arrival
of Wrentham. The visit had been expected,
and therefore excited no surprise. Philip was
struck by a change in his visitor’s manner,
which, although slight, was enough to render
the description he had just written of him a
little unfair.</p>

<p>Wrentham’s face was not that of one who
was gaily taking part in a farce. Still his bearing
suggested the careless ease of a man who
is either endowed with boundless fortune or
a sublime indifference to bankruptcy. It might
be that, being conscious of Philip’s dissatisfaction,
he assumed a more marked degree of nonchalance
than he would have done if there had been
confidence between them.</p>

<p>Philip did try to keep this rule in mind—that
when your suspicions are aroused about
any person, you should make large allowances
for the exaggerations of the meaning of his or
her actions, as interpreted by your own excited
nerves, and for the altered nervous condition of
the person who is conscious of being suspected.
But somehow, the rule did not seem to apply
to Wrentham. In favour or out of favour, he
was much the same. He was a cool-headed or
light-hearted gambler in the business of life,
and took his losses as coolly as he took his
winnings—or feigned to do so; and this feigning,
if well done, has as much effect upon the
looker-on as if the feeling were genuine.</p>

<p>‘Any news?’ Philip inquired, as he put his
letter into the desk and wheeled round to the
fire, by the side of which his visitor was already
seated.</p>

<p>‘None; except that our friend appears to consume
an extraordinary quantity of B. and S.
But Mr Shield could not be seen by any one
this evening. The man first told me he was
out; so I left your note and said I should return
in an hour. Then I marched up and down near
the door, on the watch for anybody like your
uncle. I did not see him, but I saw a friend of
mine arrive.’</p>

<p>‘Who was that?’</p>

<p>‘You know him—Beecham, who has been
living so long at the <i>King’s Head</i>.’</p>

<p>‘That was an odd coincidence.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, it seemed so,’ rejoined Wrentham, with
the tone of one who sees more than he reports.
‘Very odd that the day after your uncle leaves
the <i>Langham</i> and takes up his quarters in this
quiet private hotel, Beecham should bundle up
his traps, quit Kingshope, and come to settle in
the same house.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">{500}</span></p>

<p>‘Has he left our place, then?’</p>

<p>‘So he says—for of course I spoke to him.
He does not know where he is going to, or
whether he will return to Kingshope or not. I
said it wasn’t fair to his friends to vanish from
amongst them without a hint, or giving them a
chance to express their regret at losing him.
He said it was a way he had of making up his
mind suddenly and acting on its decision instantly.
He hoped, however, to have the pleasure of seeing
me again. With that he shook hands and bustled
into the hotel before it came into my head to ask
him if he knew Mr Shield.’</p>

<p>‘How could he know him?’ muttered Philip
a little impatiently, for this episode interrupted
the account of Wrentham’s endeavours to obtain
a reply from his uncle as to whether or not he
would consent to see him on the following
day.</p>

<p>‘Don’t know how exactly; but there are lots
of ways in which they might have met. Beecham
has travelled a bit in all sorts of odd corners of
the earth. Anyhow, I think they know each
other.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well, that is no business of ours.—Did
you see Mr Shield at last?’</p>

<p>‘No; but I got this message from him with his
compliments. He regretted that he could not
see me, but the letter should have immediate
attention.’</p>

<p>‘That is satisfactory,’ said Philip, relieved.</p>

<p>Wrentham looked at him critically, as if he
had been a horse on which a heavy bet
depended.</p>

<p>‘You are easily satisfied,’ he observed with a
light laugh; but the sound was not pleasing to
the ears of the listener. ‘Before being satisfied,
I should like to have his answer to your note,
for everything goes to the dogs if he declines to
come down handsome.’</p>

<p>‘He will not refuse: he is pledged to it.
But it is horrible to have to apply to him so
soon.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes; it is nasty having to ask a favour.
What do you mean to do if he should
say “No” plump, or make some excuse?—which
comes to the same thing, and is more unpleasant,
because it kind of holds you under the obligation
without granting you the favour.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ answered Philip rising and
walking up and down the room uneasily.</p>

<p>‘Well, I have a notion,’ said Wrentham slowly,
as he drew his hand over his chin; ‘but it seems
scarcely worth mentioning, as it would take the
form of advice, and you don’t care about my
advice, or you wouldn’t be in this mess.... I
beg your pardon: ’pon my honour, I didn’t
mean to say anything that would hurt you.’</p>

<p>‘What were you going to say?’ was Philip’s
abrupt response.</p>

<p>‘I was going to say that you ought to find out
what Beecham has to do with him. Of course
I have been pretty chummy with the old boy;
but I never could get behind his eyes. <i>You</i>
can learn what he is up to without any trouble.’</p>

<p>‘Me!—how?’</p>

<p>‘By asking Miss Heathcote.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Heathcote! What nonsense you are
talking. She knows no more about the man
than I do.’</p>

<p>‘Oh!’—There was a most provoking tone of
amused surprise in this exclamation.—‘You think
so?’</p>

<p>‘I am sure of it.’</p>

<p>Wrentham, resting his elbows on the table
and his chin on his thumbs, whilst the tips of
his fingers touched in front, stared at him
seriously.</p>

<p>‘Then you don’t know what friends they are?—that
they have been meeting daily—that they
correspond?’</p>

<p>Philip did not immediately catch the significance
of voice and manner, he was so much occupied
with other matters.</p>

<p>‘I daresay, I daresay,’ was the abstracted
answer; ‘he is always wandering about, and
they like him at Willowmere.... Do you think
we can manage to prepare the full statement of
accounts by the morning?’</p>

<p>The mention of accounts did not please Wrentham.
He jerked his head back with the grand
air of one who, being accustomed to deal with
large totals, could not think of giving his mind
to petty details.</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, if you don’t mind, I have nothing
more to say. As to the accounts, I don’t see what
you want more than your books. They are made
up, and the totals will be quite enough for Mr
Shield. They are what, as you know, I always
expected them to be—most confoundedly on the
wrong side. I warned you’——</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes; I know you warned me, and others
warned me, and the thing has turned out as bad
as you croakers could wish. That is due to my
mismanagement—to a blunder I have made
somewhere, not to any weakness in the principle
of my scheme. Taking the position as it is, I
want to find out where I have blundered.—I
do not mean to give in, and will go on as hard
as ever, if we can only tide over the present
mess.’</p>

<p>‘That’s right enough,’ ejaculated Wrentham
with an outburst of good-natured admiration;
‘but in the meanwhile, the first thing to do is
to get over the mess.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, how to do that,’ muttered Philip still
marching up and down.</p>

<p>‘The shortest way is to make sure that Mr
Shield’s mind is not prejudiced against you and
your work at the same time.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, stuff. Who wants to prejudice him against
me?’</p>

<p>‘I say, find out what Beecham is after. Maybe
he is your friend: in that case, so much the
better; and if he is not, then you will be able
to deal with him more promptly, if you have
discovered his trick in time. Ask Miss Heathcote
about him. She ought to tell you all she
knows.’</p>

<p>Philip halted, head bowed, eyes fixed on the
floor, and the words buzzing through his brain—‘She
ought to tell me all she knows.’ Certainly
she ought, and would. Then, for the first
time, there seemed to reach his ears as from a
distance the voices he had heard behind him at
the ‘dancing beeches,’ and he recalled Madge’s
agitated face as she told him that she had been
intrusted by this man with a secret which she
must not at present share with him. He had
disapproved of her conduct at the time; he disapproved
of it still more strongly now, although
he regarded it as nothing more than a mistake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">{501}</span>
into which she had been betrayed by her sympathetic
heart.</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ he said sharply, ‘I shall ask Miss
Heathcote what she knows about him. What
then?’</p>

<p>‘Why, then we shall know where we are,’
Wrentham answered gaily. ‘To be sure, if you
receive a message from Mr Shield to-morrow
morning that it is all right, there will be no
necessity to trouble Miss Heathcote.’</p>

<p>It was one of the anomalies of his association
with Wrentham—or one of the effects of the
weakness which the strain upon his nerves had
produced—that Philip was influenced by him on
those very points on which he would have least
expected himself to be subject to influence by
any one. It is true that whilst he had been all
along aware of his manager’s want of sympathy
with his work, he had discovered no reason to
suspect his honesty—and this might account for
the anomaly.</p>

<p>So, it was Wrentham who had persuaded him
that the time had come to apply to Mr Shield
for assistance at a critical juncture in his speculation;
and it was Wrentham who persuaded
him that he ought to learn from Madge the
nature of the secret confided to her by Beecham.</p>

<p>‘He won’t think much more about the accounts
to-night,’ Wrentham was saying mentally as he
went down-stairs. And his step was not so
jaunty as usual when he got into the street.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MUSHROOMS_FOR_THE_MILLION">MUSHROOMS FOR THE MILLION.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Is</span> there any one in England who does not esteem
mushrooms as delicious esculents? Their flavour
commends them to most palates, and their
value as food is quite on a par with many other
vegetables. Few of the other varieties of edible
funguses are approved of by English people,
partly through ignorance and prejudice. Yet
in many countries in Europe, about thirty kinds,
closely allied to the mushroom in flavour and
excellence, form the chief diet for thousands of the
peasants during the summer months, either fresh
from the meadows or preserved in vinegar and
oil.</p>

<p>We may, then, be very thankful to any one
who instructs us how to grow mushrooms so
that they may be as plentiful as cabbages, and
within the reach of any cottager who has a
garden and can buy a load of manure. A very
practical little treatise on Mushroom-growing
has been published by Mr Wright (price one
shilling) at the office of the <i>Journal of Horticulture</i>,
171 Fleet Street, London, from which
we propose to give a slight sketch of his plan,
recommending the purchase of the work to those
who desire to follow out his directions. It would
seem to be a most profitable investment in these
days, when the farmers have so much reason for
complaint, as the remuneration far exceeds that
of any other vegetable. Fruit-crops as well as
vegetables are seriously affected by winter-cold,
high winds, and spring frosts; and from twenty
to forty pounds an acre is an average value of
the profits arising from either. In Cornwall and
Devonshire, the early potatoes and valuable fruits
may give from one to two hundred pounds an
acre, but this is very exceptional. Yet mushroom-growing
exceeds even this profit.</p>

<p>We will turn now to Mr Wright’s actual
calculation, founded on the well-ascertained fact,
that a mushroom-bed two and a half feet wide
and one yard long, and situated in the open air,
yields produce of the value of fifteen shillings, and
that the cost of production is five shillings per
yard. There have been seasons when the price
was very high and an extraordinary crop produced,
the returns having amounted to forty-five
shillings the yard. The average price to be
got in London is one shilling per pound-weight.
Take the width of the beds at two feet and a half,
with five feet of space between each bed, which
is necessary for moving freely between the beds.
There are four thousand eight hundred and forty
square yards in an acre, which would allow of
nineteen hundred and thirty-six yards for beds;
these, at fifteen shillings a yard, give a profit
of fourteen hundred and fifty-two pounds; from
which deduct rent, eighteen pounds, and cost of
production at five shillings a yard—leaving the
very profitable balance of nine hundred and fifty
pounds. The purchase of the spawn, if not grown
on the ground, would be an additional cost of
one shilling a yard. From October to July,
seven thousand pounds-weight were really
despatched to market from a length of five
hundred yards, and sold for three hundred and
sixty-seven pounds, besides the ketchup that
was made from the overgrown specimens.</p>

<p>The next question is, how to grow this valuable
article of commerce. First of all, the stable-manure
(used as a basis) must be of the best
kind, to which oak or beech leaves may be
added, as they induce a steady heat; but the
large soft leaves of the sycamore, &amp;c., are unsuitable.
A slight sprinkling of tan, with a very
small quantity of salt and guano, may be advantageous;
an ounce of each to a barrowful of
the material will be sufficient. However, many
successful growers use none of these things, but
depend entirely on well-prepared manure and
good spawn.</p>

<p>The best time for beginners to prepare their
beds is towards the end of July or in August.
In three weeks the manure will be ready for
forming into ridges; in another week, spawn
may be inserted. Eight weeks after, the mushrooms
will appear, and continue bearing for
three months. Now for the preparation. Take
the manure as it comes from the stalls, the
greater part consisting of straw more or less
discoloured. When on the ground, fork it over,
casting aside the long clean straw only; the
remainder, forming a mixture of half and half,
should be mixed and piled into a heap, as if for
a hotbed for a frame. Very little water, if any,
will be needed. In four or six days the fermentation
should be in full force and the mass
hot. The work of turning and purifying now
begins. Every lock of straw and flake of manure
must be separated and thoroughly incorporated,
the outsides being placed in the centre. From
four to six turnings on alternate days are
necessary. Thus the mass is sweetened and the
straw broken with the least possible loss of
ammonia. A little practice will guide to the
knowledge of when the beds are in a right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">{502}</span>
condition; the appearance and the smell form
the best indications. There should be an inseparable
mass of straw and manure, a slightly
greasy tinge, and a warm brown colour. A lump
drawn from the interior should not smell offensively,
but possess a pungent and somewhat
agreeable scent, with a slight odour of mushrooms.
If these features are not present, another turning
is required. Texture, heat, purity, and moisture,
are the four important requisites—sufficiently
moist to be pressed into a mass, and yet not a
drop of water to be squeezed from it.</p>

<p>The site for the bed is the next consideration.
Shelter from cold winds is a great advantage;
a garden-wall to the north and a hedge on the
south is the best position; but by the use of
wattled hurdles, admirable results have been
obtained. The sheltered nook of any garden or
homestead may be better used for this purpose
than for any other kind of produce. If the soil be
good in quality, it is well to remove it where the
beds are to be made to the depth of several inches,
and place it on a heap, to be laid afterwards on
the top of the beds. The excavations can be
filled with rubble, which insures a dry foundation,
as water should never accumulate on the surface.
As mentioned previously, the beds should be two
feet and a half wide at the base, six inches at the
top, and two feet and a half high. At this angle,
the soil will adhere to the sides, and much of the
rain will pass off freely. But where the rainfall
is great, they must be protected with canvas
coverings over the straw at the top. A couple
of sticks a yard long will prove an easy guide to
the form. Insert them two and a half feet apart,
and draw the tops to within six inches of each
other, and there is the outline of the bed. Soon,
however, a line will only be needed; the eye can
do all the rest. Larger beds may be made; but
let the sides be as steep as possible, firm, and
smooth, that the rain may not penetrate. In
addition to its being heavily beaten with forks,
it must be twice trodden down—once at the depth
of eighteen inches, and again when three feet
high. The appearance will be that of a thatched
roof in miniature, and is quite a work of art for
smoothness and outline. To prevent the bed
drying in the centre, holes should be bored with
an iron bar, about ten inches apart, along the
ridge to the bottom of the bed, and a few sticks
put in afterwards, to indicate the temperature.</p>

<p>There are many varieties of mushroom seed,
or spawn, as it is termed. Large quantities
are imported from France, where it is made
up in flakes, instead of bricks, as with us. Good
virgin spawn made up in bricks is decidedly
the best, but the price is as high as two
guineas a bushel. Mr Veitch, King’s Road,
Chelsea, or Mr Barter, Harrow Road, London, and
many others, may be relied on for the small
quantity which would be required for a beginner.
The lumps are nine inches long and six wide;
sixteen of them make a bushel. They are composed
of soil and manure. When partially
dried, the spawn is inserted, and under a
genial heat it penetrates the entire mass. Kept
cool and dry, the vitality lasts for years. A
good mushroom brick when broken should
resemble a mass of silvery cobwebs. In growing
these esculents for the market, it is most advantageous
to use the spawn liberally and in large
lumps. A brick may be divided into eight parts,
and inserted about nine inches apart, level with
the surface of the ridges. Holes should not be
made, but the manure held up with the left hand,
the lump pushed in with the right; there are
then no interstices for the accumulation of steam,
which is fatal to the mycelium. The time for
sowing is when the heat of the bed is decreasing,
but has not fallen below eighty degrees an inch
below the surface.</p>

<p>If the bed be in the right condition, the spawn
will begin to spread in three days, after which
the top layer may be covered with soil. A
little litter may cover the bed previously, if
the heat requires it. The kind of soil is not
an unimportant matter, and strong turfy loam
yields the best produce, such as a gardener would
use for growing chrysanthemums and roses.
From this, mushrooms are frequently cut weighing
half a pound. These are termed ‘broilers,’
and are much in demand in the foreign hotels in
London. The top layer from a pasture in which
buttercups rather than daisies are plentiful, forms
an excellent soil. It may even be enriched with
bone-meal, if light and sandy, but on no account
with ordinary manure, as some unwelcome fungi
might spring up. The thickness of this covering
of soil must be from one to two inches. It may
be slightly moistened before putting on, not after,
lest dry fissures should form and the heat escape.
The whole should be made firm and smooth, but
not plastered like a cement floor. The temperature
of September is a guide to the heat required
to be kept up, as that is the month when mushrooms
grow naturally in the open air. An
average of fifty-eight degrees must be considered
the highest, but they will be found among the
grass meadows as low as forty-seven degrees. On
a mild day in January, a bed was beginning to
bear largely in the open air under a layer of straw
nine inches thick. Cold does no real injury to
mushroom beds; it only stops their growth, but
does not destroy the spawn. They may even be
frozen through, and yet, when the spring melts
the frost, they will bear. Too high a temperature
is much more destructive, and the cause of many
failures.</p>

<p>After all this preparation is made, the routine
of management consists in maintaining the beds
at an equable temperature, watering them at the
right time, and gathering the crops. Sufficient
straw has been shaken from the manure when
first brought in to cover the beds; it is the best
that can be used, and when dry, its peculiar nature
seems to agree with the mushrooms better than
clean sweet straw or hay. If the weather be mild,
six inches of litter will suffice; whilst during a
prolonged frost, two feet or more, with mats,
canvas, or some such material, will be required.
The proper temperature can be determined by
the hand; if there is the slightest warmth felt
when placed on the soil under the straw, that
is right; or if the thermometer be laid there at
night and has risen to fifty degrees in the
morning.</p>

<p>During fine weather in summer, autumn, and
spring, the beds require frequent watering. The
soil should never become dry, and the time chosen
must be early in the afternoon on a sunny day.
The covering on the beds will then be warm;
and on this—not under it—water must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">{503}</span>
sprinkled in sufficient quantity to percolate
through and gradually moisten the soil. Immediately
after, the beds must be covered with mats,
to prevent the evaporation, and the vapour that
will be generated will result in a warm, humid
atmosphere, so suitable for the growth of mushrooms.
The mats may be removed in the morning.
Beginners should endeavour to have beds beginning
to bear in April or October; they are not
profitable after June, as, owing to the nitrogen
they contain, mushrooms speedily decay in hot
weather, and become very indigestible.</p>

<p>When the beds are partially exhausted by continuous
bearing, a free application of liquid
manure, heated to a hundred degrees, may be
given, and one or two ounces of salt added to
each gallon. It is a well-known fact that sowing
salt over grass and pastureland often produces an
enormous crop of mushrooms, whilst on other
parts of the same land not one is to be found.
In a small farm the author is acquainted with,
mushrooms grow abundantly among the potato
and turnip crops, whilst none are found in the
neighbourhood; the only difference being that
the farmer sowed two hundredweight of salt per
acre every year. Of course, the spawn is there,
but the salt develops its growth.</p>

<p>After all this preparation, the pleasant time
of gathering the crop will come; and here knowledge
and care are alike requisite. The old plan
was to cut off the mushroom above the soil; now,
it is pulled by hand, and if the stump be left
close to the surface, it is at once scooped out with
a knife, leaving a round cavity as large as a walnut.
This plan increases the productiveness of
the beds; for if the threads of the mycelium are
not broken, they expend their strength in masses
of mould or fungus. On the other hand, when
scooped out, small tubercles form, and develop
into mushrooms, a fine ring appearing round each
cavity. When gathering, a small portion only
of the bed should be uncovered, especially in cold
weather, and re-covered as quickly as possible.
It is not unusual for nine or ten pounds to be
gathered at once; and in the case of young beds,
the crop may be cleared off twice a week. As a
rule, a good bed will yield ten gatherings—seven
large, the first and last two lighter. It is well
to separate them into two baskets, if intended for
the market—one for buttons and cups, the other
for broilers, as it saves time at the weighing-table.
The stems should always be retained, as the
mushrooms keep sound for a much longer period.
To the salesman, the packing is of consequence.
One pound is put into each punnet—the baskets
which every one knows, made of shavings. But
few are aware what a large trade there is in these
little articles, or where they are made. It is to
Brentford or Hammersmith that we must go to
see the juvenile population busy at work making
these cheap and useful articles. They are sold
in rolls of three dozens, of different sizes—‘deep
pounds’ and ‘flat pounds,’ which may be bought
for from four to six shillings the gross of Mr
Nicholls, 377 Goldhawk Road, Hammersmith.
After the loose soil has been taken from the
stems, the mushrooms are neatly packed and tied
down with raffia, the best and cheapest tying
material, and then placed in wooden packing-cases
for transmission to towns. Everywhere, in large
centres, the greengrocers are glad to receive them,
as the demand is greater than the supply, the
price varying from one shilling to two shillings
the pound from October to June.</p>

<p>Whenever the supply is too large, good unadulterated
ketchup finds a ready market, and
mushroom-growing is profitable if only for the
juice alone. What is now sold as mushroom
ketchup is rarely pure, bullocks’ liver being
one of the usual component parts. The spent
beds are most valuable for manure for the land
or for potting the higher class of plants, and
are by no means exhausted. The manure often
lies for months during decomposition before it
is fit for the land. Why should not this be
utilised? It is a most suitable investment for
market-gardeners who are not far from a town,
and for cottagers who hold a few acres, keeping
one or two horses and cows. If they can make
poultry pay, much more mushrooms. Clergymen
and professional men are not unwilling to add
something to their income, and might do much
in their parishes to improve the condition of the
working-classes by thus making use of what too
often lies wasting in the farmyards.</p>

<p>This is but a sketch of Mr Wright’s little book,
which should be in the possession of all who
intend to be mushroom-growers.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> there were but very few passengers on board
the Peninsular and Oriental steamer <i>Sicilia</i>,
outward bound for the Far East, we did not
anticipate the usual amount of fun and festivity
which are, strangely enough, more remarkable
features of life on outward-bound than on homeward-bound
steamers. But what we missed in
frolic we certainly had made up to us in the
shape of excitement. We numbered about a
dozen in all; but of these, three only need
individual description.</p>

<p>The principal personage, in accordance with the
ancient dictum that a woman is at the bottom
of everything, was a pretty young widow, a
Londoner, who was on her way to join her friends
living in Shanghai. The worship of the fair sex
is nowhere more ardent than aboard ship, partly,
perhaps, because its members contrive to put on
under such exceptional circumstances their most
captivating airs and graces; and chiefly, it must
be admitted, although the admission is ungallant,
because, beyond eating and sleeping, there is
little else to do than to offer homage to whatever
goddess presents herself. Hence Mrs Fuller, as
she was named, reigned sole and unapproached
monarch of the ship. Had she been other than
she was, she would have occupied this position;
but being tall and fair and graceful, she
assuredly merited every tribute of admiration
laid at her feet. The darts she unconsciously
shot around fixed themselves most firmly in the
hearts of the remaining members of the prominent
trio to be described. The first was a young
Englishman named Goodhew, going out to the
consular service in Yedo; the other was a young
Irishman named MacWhirter, going to the same
city in the Japanese government Telegraph
Department. Goodhew was as typical an Englishman
as was MacWhirter a typical Irishman,
indeed, more so, for Mac was a victim to a most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">{504}</span>
un-Milesian failing—he could not take a joke.
Goodhew was a big, broad-shouldered, ruddy-faced,
blue-eyed, fair-haired fellow, who ate like
an alderman, was always laughing when he was
not eating or sleeping, and was half the life and
soul of our little community. Terence MacWhirter
was the other half. He could sing a
capital song and tell a capital story, his story-telling
powers eclipsing his song-singing, inasmuch
as with the gravest conceivable demeanour
he would endeavour to foist upon us the most
palpable fiction as the most solemn truth. ‘As
true as oi’m standing here,’ was a concluding
phrase of his, which soon became a catchword
on board, and synonymous with what was most
extravagant and improbable.</p>

<p>The apple of discord which the fair Londoner
was destined to throw amongst us fell between
Goodhew and Mac, who, long before she joined
us at Brindisi, had singled out each other as
opponents upon the one particular question of
belief or disbelief in ghosts. Strangely enough,
Goodhew, who had won the Humane Society’s
medal for saving life, was a firm believer in
the theory that the departed from this life
revisit their old haunts. Equally strange was
it that Mac, although a fervid, imaginative Irishman,
pooh-poohed ghosts and omens and visions
and dreams and second-sight as being unworthy
of the consideration of a practical nineteenth-century
human being; and the more instances
Goodhew quoted in support of his creed, the
more violently would Mac exclaim: ‘Now, look
ye here, Mister Goodhew; oi’ll stand the man
an onlimited dinner up to a couple of sovereigns
who can prove that he has ever seen a ghost;
an’ if a man can show me a ghost, bedad, oi’ll
show him what oi’ll do wid it!’</p>

<p>The arguing matches and disputes between the
two opponents formed our principal amusement
during the tedious passage from Southampton
to Brindisi. Then Mrs Fuller came on board,
and their antagonism assumed a new shape.
Goodhew helped her on board. Score No. 1 for
the Englishman. But Mac lent her his cane-chair,
and equalised matters. Goodhew sat next
to her at table; but Mac sat opposite, which was
as good, for in talking to her, he was obliged
to raise his voice, and by so doing obtained a
monopoly of the conversation. To her credit it
must be said that she behaved exactly as a
young lady placed in such peculiar circumstances
should behave. She showed no partiality
to one more than to the other. She laughed
heartily at Mac’s jokes, and listened attentively
to Goodhew’s quiet common-sense and commonplaces.
If one of them gained a trifling advantage
one day, it was made up to the other the
next; and so, whilst conscientiously she believed
she was pleasing both, in reality she was stirring
up a fire between the two which was fated ultimately
to burst into a tragedy.</p>

<p>So matters went on. By the time Alexandria
was reached, we, the audience, agreed that Goodhew
held a slight advantage, inasmuch as the
passage across the Mediterranean having been
stormy, poor Mac spent the greater part of his
time in his berth; whilst Goodhew, who was a
good sailor, was brought into uninterrupted contact
with Mrs Fuller, who was also <i>mal-de-mer</i>
proof.</p>

<p>It may be imagined that when we were sick
of quoits and ‘bull-board’ and deck-cricket and
walking-races, the little comedy played by the trio
formed our chief amusement. Its ups and downs,
its various phases, its situations, were subjects
of attentive watchfulness on our part. We were
like a party of special correspondents taking notes
of an important campaign. We received from
one another news of victory or defeat, of attacks
foiled, of successful stratagems, of bold strokes,
of new moves, with as much earnestness as if
our own interests were at stake with the issue
of the contest. If one of us hurried for’ard with
a joyful face, it was not to tell of a confident
prophecy on the part of the skipper that we
should have an easy time in the monsoon, or that
we should make Aden ahead of schedule-time;
but to relate some splendid stroke on the part of
Mac, or an admirable counter delivered by Goodhew.
Occasionally, there were uninteresting lulls
in the conflict, and during these periods we
were driven to our wits’ end for amusement,
and the time passed slowly and heavily; but
when the battle was in full swing, the long
hours of the tropical day sped but too quickly.
Our doctor took an especial interest in the
drama, and by virtue of his official position, was
enabled to see far more of its ins and outs
and by-play than we outsiders, and often when
matters seemed to slacken a bit, would infuse
fresh life and fire by some adroit, mischievous
remark.</p>

<p>Open hostility soon became the order of the
day between Mac and Goodhew. Hitherto, they
had been simply cold and distant to one another,
interlarding their conversation profusely with
‘Sirs’ and ‘I beg your pardons;’ but by the
time we reached Penang, they were hardly civil
to each other. The climax was reached at
Penang. According to the usual custom, a party
was made up to visit the celebrated waterfall.
Most of us went: Skipper, Doctor, Mrs Fuller,
Goodhew, Mac, and half a dozen of us outsiders.
We arrived at the waterfall after the well-known
broiling ascent, rhapsodised over it,
sketched the joss-house, partook of a sumptuous
tiffin beneath its roof, and were about to return
to the quay, when Mrs Fuller espied a dead
buzzard floating in the waters of the pool. ‘Oh,
how I should like a few feathers from that
beautiful bird!’ she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mac and Goodhew rushed to execute the
commission. We outsiders never dreamed of
interference, as we foresaw an important scene
in the drama. Mac was armed with his walking-stick,
Goodhew had seized a long bamboo stem.
Mac was upon one side of the pool, Goodhew
on the other, and the buzzard floated in the
middle between them.</p>

<p>The faces and figures of the two men were
perfect studies of sternness and resolution; they
stretched and craned, they knelt, they floundered,
they hopped up and jumped down; for the time-being
the entire universe of each of them was
concentrated in that palm-shaded pool. But
the bird stuck resolutely in the middle, in spite
of coaxing and flopping and all sorts of cunning
endeavours to waft it to one side or the other.
Suddenly a puff of wind carried it towards Mac.
His face lighted up with joy, and he uttered a
smothered ‘Hooroo!’ In a moment his walking-stick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">{505}</span>
was under it, he was slowly but surely
pulling it towards him; when there was a vision
of a sort of fishing-rod in mid-air, a momentary
struggle and splash, and Goodhew triumphantly
dragged it towards him. Mac made a
desperate dash at the retreating spoil, missed his
footing, and fell plump into the pool. Our long-restrained
feelings were no more to be kept in,
and the laughter which followed awakened
the echoes of the solitary Penang waterfall.
To emerge from the water, hatless, dripping, and
vanquished, was humiliating enough for poor
Mac; but when he looked at Mrs Fuller, and
saw that she was endeavouring to stifle immoderate
laughter with her pocket-handkerchief, his
cup of misery was full, and without another
word, he strode off ahead of us on the path
leading to the Settlement, and was soon lost
to view.</p>

<p>We sailed that evening for Singapore. Mac
was not visible. Next evening, however, as we
were sitting on deck after dinner smoking our
cigars and gazing at the peerless panorama of
the tropical heavens, we saw him come on deck.
We hushed our talk, for we felt that something
was pending. Goodhew was sitting by
Mrs Fuller’s chair—that is, poor Mac’s chair—at
some distance from us. Mac seeing this, strode
up and down the deck behind them. Presently,
Mrs Fuller rose, wished us good-night, and
disappeared below. We nudged one another,
watched round the corners of our eyes, and
listened.</p>

<p>Mac strode up to Goodhew, who was approaching
us. ‘Mister Goodhew,’ he said, ‘oi call
that a dirty mane trick!’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean, sir?’ angrily retorted
Goodhew, stopping short.</p>

<p>‘Oi mane what oi say, sir,’ said Mac. ‘It was
a dirty mane trick. Mrs Fuller asked me to
get the bird for her, and oi got it; and you
come in with a pole like a mast, and you fish
it out under me very oyes!’</p>

<p>‘Under your very stick, you mean, Mac,’ said
Goodhew, laughing.</p>

<p>‘No matter what oi mane!’ exclaimed the
infuriated Irishman. ‘Oi mane, that when one
gintleman recaives a commission from a lady,
and another gintleman executes it by a mane
trick, the other gintleman’s no gintleman at all
at all—but a cad, Mister Goodhew, a cad!’</p>

<p>‘I say, Mac, draw it mild,’ said Goodhew,
in his turn irritated; ‘we’re not all bogtrotters
here!’</p>

<p>‘Is it bogtrotter ye’re callin’ me!’ exclaimed
Mac in a frenzy. ‘Bedad, oi’ll tache ye to call a
MacWhirter a bogtrotter, ye spalpeen!’ And he
sprang at Goodhew furiously.</p>

<p>Goodhew seized him by the waist, and in
another minute would have certainly dropped
Mac overboard, had we not all jumped up and
interposed. Mac danced and kicked and struggled
and used every vilifying expression he could.
Goodhew also was endeavouring to wrest himself
from our grasp; but we held on, and the
opponents seeing that they could not get at each
other, gradually desisted from trying.</p>

<p>‘Doctor!’ said Mac, after a breathing-space,
‘this is an affair for immadiate settlement.’</p>

<p>‘Pooh! my dear fellow,’ said the officer,
‘who can fight duels on the deck of a P. and
O. steamer? Better wait till we get to Hong-kong;
there’s plenty of room there.’</p>

<p>‘Hong-kong be it then,’ said Mac.—‘Mister
Goodhew, oi’ll send ye me card in the morning.’</p>

<p>‘All right, Mac,’ replied Goodhew, who was
recovering his good temper. ‘Send as many as
you like. But don’t you think we’re a couple
of fools, to be going on in this absurd way about
a trifle?’</p>

<p>‘A trifle ye call it?’ roared Mac. ‘An’ if
there’s a fool hereabouts, it isn’t Terence MacWhirter;
but ye needn’t travel very far to find
him.’</p>

<p>The doctor whispered in Goodhew’s ear. The
latter nodded and smiled, and said: ‘All right,
Mac. You challenge me to a duel. I accept it.
Pistols?’</p>

<p>‘Of coorse,’ replied Mac. ‘Ye didn’t think oi
mane fishing-rods? Insulting a MacWhirter’s no
trifle, oi tell ye.’</p>

<p>So they separated.</p>

<p>It may be imagined that the chief topic on
board during the interval between Singapore and
Hong-kong was the approaching duel. Mac had
given out more than once that he was no novice;
and he certainly had shown himself a dead-shot
with a rook-rifle at bottles or pieces of wood;
but whether, considering the extreme excitability
of his nature, he would preserve his calmness on
the field of battle sufficiently to make any use
of his accomplishment, we were inclined to doubt.
Goodhew had never fired a pistol in his life;
but there was an easy, calm confidence about
him that foretold no want of nerve on his
part.</p>

<p>‘Pat,’ said the doctor, on the evening before
our arrival at Hong-kong, ‘haven’t you a qualm
of conscience about going to shoot this poor
fellow?’</p>

<p>‘Faith, doctor,’ replied Mac, ‘the odds are even.
If he wins the toss, he shoots me.’</p>

<p>‘You’re not afraid of the consequences of
manslaughter?’ continued the doctor. ‘I don’t
mean the judicial consequences, but the remorse,
the fear of being haunted’——</p>

<p>‘Doctor,’ said Mac, ‘oi took ye for the only
sensible man on the ship, and ye go and talk
blarney about haunting and all that. Oi tell
ye, doctor, oi’m not a believer in spirits; and
if oi kill Goodhew, and his ghost makes a pother
about me afterwards, oi’ll have to settle him
as well. Look ye, doctor, ye and the whole
lot of ’em want to get me off this duel; but
oi’ve been insulted; and if oi put up with
it, oi’ll not be worthy of the name of MacWhirter
at all at all.’</p>

<p>The next evening we steamed into Hong-kong
harbour. Mrs Fuller was on deck, admiring
the effects of the great mountain shadows
upon the moonlit water, and of the innumerable
twinkling lights from the shore, which mount
up and up until they seem to mingle with the
stars.</p>

<p>Mac was standing by her chair. ‘Mrs Fuller,’
he said, in a low impressive voice, ‘this is a
beauteous scene. It remoinds me of Doblin Bay
or the Cove of Cark. It is a sad scene.’</p>

<p>‘A sad scene, Mr MacWhirter!’ said Mrs
Fuller. ‘Why, I was just thinking it was a gay
scene, with all those lights, and’——</p>

<p>‘It is a sad scene for those who are looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">{506}</span>
at it for the last toime, Mrs Fuller,’ said Mac in
an almost sepulchral tone.</p>

<p>‘Gracious! Mr MacWhirter, what do you mean?’
asked Mrs Fuller. ‘What a dreadfully uncomfortable
thing to say!’</p>

<p>‘Oi mane, Mrs Fuller,’ replied Mac, ‘that this
toime to-morrow noight there’ll be one less
passenger on board the <i>Sicilia</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Why, of course, Mr MacWhirter; for I suppose
our little company will be broken up here, and it
is never pleasant separating from kind friends.’</p>

<p>‘Ye mistake me,’ said Mac. ‘The moon that
will shoine to-morrow noight will look upon the
corpse of either Mister Goodhew or of Terence
MacWhirter; and it’ll be all for the sake of
yerself, Mrs Fuller.’</p>

<p>Mrs Fuller saw that Mac was serious, and
the idea flashed across her mind that the two
rivals for her hand were about to fight a duel
on her account, so she resolved to take the
earliest opportunity of speaking to the captain
about it.</p>

<p>She did speak to the captain, who spoke
certain words to her in return.</p>

<p>Very early the next morning, before even the
sun had peered round the corner of the Victoria
Peak, the captain’s gig put off from the <i>Sicilia</i>.
In it were the captain himself, the doctor,
Goodhew, Mac, and we outsiders. We were
soon alongside the Bund, and in a few seconds
were being whisked away in the direction of
the Happy Valley as fast as chairmen could
take us. We went swiftly by the cemetery gate
and the Grand Stand to the extreme end of
the Valley, where there was no chance of interruption.</p>

<p>After each of the combatants had been armed
with one of the captain’s pistols, the doctor
measured fifteen paces. The coin was spun into
the air. Mac won the toss, and took up his
position, as did Goodhew.</p>

<p>‘Captain,’ said Goodhew, ‘if—if I fall, you’ll
find a memorandum as to the disposition of my
property in a tin box in my cabin. Here’s the key.’</p>

<p>‘At the word Three,’ said the captain, ‘Mr
MacWhirter will fire.’</p>

<p>Mac raised his pistol, half closed his left eye,
and took aim.</p>

<p>‘One! Two! Three!’</p>

<p>He fired. Goodhew, with a cry, pressed his
hands to his head, and then fell like a stone
with one deep groan. The red stain on the right
temple told Mac the fatal truth. The Irishman’s
vaunts and threats had been justified.</p>

<p>‘You’ve done it, Mac!’ whispered the captain
in a voice of agony. ‘Come away as fast as you
can. The doctor will attend to the poor fellow,
if life still remains.’</p>

<p>And so Mac and the captain hastened away,
leaving Goodhew on the ground, with us gathered
around him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As we were to shift over to the smaller steamer
which was to convey us to Yokohama the next
day, and were to bid farewell to Mrs Fuller and
the captain and the old <i>Sicilia</i>, the banquet that
evening was of an unusually lavish description:
the champagne went merrily round with jest and
gibe, as if there had never been such a being as
poor Goodhew in existence. Even Mac aroused
himself after a few glasses, although at first
he was rather solemn, and remarked: ‘Ye’re a
rum lot, all of ye. If oi’d been killed instead of
Mister Goodhew, ye’d have enjoyed your dinner
and drink all the same. Oi’m sorry for him;
but it’ll be a lesson to Sassenachs not to insult
Oirishmen.’</p>

<p>Then Mrs Fuller’s health was drunk, and the
captain’s, and every one else’s, and not until a
small-hour of the morning did we think of
breaking up.</p>

<p>‘I say, Mac,’ said the doctor, ‘aren’t you afraid
of seeing poor Goodhew to-night?’</p>

<p>‘Whisht, doctor; ye’ve taken more than’s
good for ye!’ was the contemptuous reply.</p>

<p>As the ship’s bell tolled two o’clock, we prepared
to turn into bed, when the saloon door
opened quietly, and a tall figure, ghastly white,
with a crimson patch on its face, glided a few
inches in. Mac was seated next to the door,
and saw it. His cigar fell from his fingers,
beads of perspiration burst upon his forehead,
and he trembled violently.</p>

<p>‘What on earth is the matter, Mac?’ we asked.</p>

<p>‘Why!—Don’t ye see? There, at the door!—Him!
Mister Goodhew!’ stammered Mac.</p>

<p>‘Nonsense, man; you’re dreaming. There’s
nobody there at all!’ we said.</p>

<p>‘Strikes me you’ve had a drop too much, Mac,’
said the doctor, quietly.</p>

<p>The figure still stood there with its eyes fixed
on Mac, who, after remaining for a few moments
petrified with horror, rushed with a shriek into
his cabin.</p>

<p>Such a night as the poor fellow passed will
never be known to any one but himself, although
it was manifest that he was undergoing extreme
agony by the groans and smothered cries which
we heard for a long time after he had turned
in. He was not visible at breakfast the next
morning; nothing was seen of him during the
process of transferring passengers, mails, and
baggage from the <i>Sicilia</i> to the Yokohama
steamer; and we began to fear that the poor
fellow had really been affected by what he
had seen, and had taken some rash step. However,
about an hour before our starting-time,
it was reported that Mac had come on board.
There was a festive assembly in the saloon, the
captain, doctor, and officers of the <i>Sicilia</i> being
our guests, although an unusual spruceness in
the general costume proclaimed that the affair
was something more than a mere return of the
compliment paid us by the captain of the <i>Sicilia</i>
on the previous evening.</p>

<p>The doctor had risen to his feet, was clearing
his throat preparatory to an important speech,
when the saloon door was pushed open, and
Mac looked in—not the careless, swaggering
Mac of past days, but Mac haggard, weird,
scarcely human, with unkempt locks and
bloodshot eyes. Goodhew was seated next to
the pretty Londoner. ‘Hillo, Mac, old fellow;
come in, come in; you’re just in time,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘By the powers!’ exclaimed Mac, ‘ye’re not
dead, Mister Goodhew!’</p>

<p>‘No, old fellow,’ replied Goodhew, with a
laugh. ‘But if your pistol had carried a bullet,
I should have been.’</p>

<p>‘But the blood on your forehead—I saw
it!’ cried Mac.—‘And Mrs Fuller—she’s wid
ye, I see!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">{507}</span></p>

<p>‘No, no, Mac; wrong this time,’ returned Goodhew,
smiling. ‘There was no blood on my forehead;
and it isn’t Mrs Fuller that’s beside me.’</p>

<p>‘Whisht, man! I’m not draming now; I
know what I’m talking about,’ exclaimed Mac.
‘D’ye mane that there was no blood on your
forehead after I’d hit ye, and d’ye mane that
it isn’t Mrs Fuller alongside of ye at all?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, old fellow,’ said Goodhew, rising, and
stretching out his hand to the bewildered
Irishman. ‘The mark on my forehead was
only a little red paint carried in the palm of
my hand, and ready to be slapped on the moment
you discharged your deadly weapon; and the
lady’——</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, the lady?’ interposed Mac with
eagerness.</p>

<p>‘The lady was made Mrs Goodhew about a
couple of hours back,’ calmly replied the Englishman.
‘Give us your hand, and drink our healths.’</p>

<p>Mac did both, and ever after remained a
firm friend of Goodhew’s, although always a
little touchy on the subject of ghosts.</p>

SHETLAND.</h2>
</div>


<h3 title="PART II.">IN TWO PARTS.—PART II.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A relative</span> of mine, now dead, used to be a
mighty seal-hunter. It was before the days of
the modern ‘arms of precision,’ long before breech-loaders
were in common use, and even before the
Enfield or Minié rifles were invented. In those
days, the old muzzle-loading rifle was found to
be not a trustworthy weapon; he therefore used
a very thick metalled fowling-piece, which was
deadly up to sixty or eighty yards. He had a
splendid boat, which he named the <i>Haff-fish</i>, about
seventeen feet of keel, a capital sea-boat, equally
good for sailing and rowing, safe, therefore, in
bad weather and rough sea, and at the same time
handy to manage when rapid movements might
be required, such as landing in narrow creeks,
or on slippery shelving rocks, or shallow beaches
with a surf on. His crew was composed of four
picked men from amongst his fishermen tenants,
and his henchman, who was as much friend and
adviser as servant, a man of great natural sagacity,
intelligence, and fertility of resource, and of prodigious
bodily strength; all of them first-class
boatmen, expert pilots, familiar with every rock
and reef and tideway on the coast and amongst
the islands, and withal steady, bright, intelligent
fellows. Master and men, all save one, gone now!
With this crew, my uncle was wont to start on
his seal-hunting expeditions. He would be absent
for a week, sometimes more, if the weather should
turn out unfavourable; for the distance from his
residence to the haunts of the seals was considerable.
The first day would be spent amongst the
nearest islands; and in the evening he would
land, and spend the night in the hospitable
mansion of one of his brother lairds, where he
was always a welcome guest, his boatmen at the
same time making good their quarters at very
small cost in the nearest fishermen’s cottages.
Next day, and each day while the expedition
lasted, he would explore new hunting-ground,
spending the nights at some other friends’ houses;
and so he would hunt all the islands in Blummel
Sound and Yell Sound, the Holms of Gloup, the
Neeps of Gravaland, the long line of precipitous
coast on the west side of Roonees Hill, the Ramna
Stacks, and even the distant Vee Skerries, and
other places well known as the principal haunts
of the seal. Sometimes, of course, the weather,
always fickle in those latitudes, would put a stop
to all sport. Not often, but sometimes, even with
the most favourable weather, he would return
‘clean.’ At other times he would bring back a
number of very substantial trophies of his prowess.
In some seasons he would bag—<i>boat</i> I should
rather say—as many as forty or fifty. In ten
years, during which he kept a careful record of
the number he shot, he secured close upon three
hundred of both species, and of various ages and
sizes, besides killing a considerable number more,
which sunk, and he was unable to recover. The
most he shot in one day was eleven, ten of
which he secured. Not a bad day’s sport.</p>

<p>I have often heard him tell with pride the
story of the most deadly shot he ever fired. The
weapon was a favourite fowling-piece charged with
two bullets, which occasionally wrought great
havoc. A small herd of tang-fish was lying on a
rock within easy range of some large boulders in
the ebb, close to the water’s edge, to which, with
infinite labour and circumspection, my relative had
crept. Very cautiously, his piece on a good rest,
he took a well-calculated aim at the seals, lying
close together in a particularly favourable position,
and fired. The first bullet killed no fewer than
three, and the second ball struck, but did not
kill two others, which floundered into the water
and escaped; but the other three were secured.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary <i>hour’s</i> sport I have ever
heard of was that of a young Shetlander, about
three years ago. Reports of it had reached me;
but they seemed so incredible, that I thought they
must be exaggerated. I therefore wrote to the
gentleman himself for the particulars; so I can
vouch for the accuracy of what I am going to
relate. I quote from his letter:</p>

<p>‘My evening sport at Muckla Skerry was certainly
a good one. I started from the Whalsay
Skerries about five o’clock of an evening about
the end of August or first of September 1881.
When nearing the rock, I could see with a glass
that it was almost covered with seals—I should
say there would have been eighty or more—but
all took to the water before a shot was fired, and
while we were three to four hundred yards off,
and were soon sporting about the boat, but keeping
at a respectable distance. It had been perfectly
calm for some days, and the sea was like
a mirror. I fired eight shots from a short Enfield
rifle with government ball cartridge. Two shots
missed, and the other six secured a seal each.
They were all shot in the water; and singular
to say, every one floated on the surface till we
took hold of it. One of them was a large
fish, measuring six feet four inches long; the
others would run from three and a half to five
feet in length.... I feel certain I could have
shot as many more, if we could have taken them
in the boat; but the boat was only ten and a
half feet keel, and I had four sturdy oatmeal-fed
islanders with me, so that you can fancy how
much freeboard we had when the six seals were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">{508}</span>
in our little craft. The time we were at the rock
did not exceed forty minutes, and I think that
half the time was expended in getting the largest
seal into the boat. This was no easy matter,
and attended with very considerable risk; but
he was quite a prize, and we did not like to let
him go.’</p>

<p>Several things in this interesting and spirited
account are, so far as I am aware, unprecedented
in the annals of seal-hunting in this country. I
have never known or heard of any one in so
short a time and out of a single herd getting so
many fair shots. When one gets amongst a lot
of seals, swimming and diving around the boat,
one shot is commonly all that you can hope for,
and whether you kill or not, it is almost invariably
sufficient to send the rest at once far beyond
range. Then out of eight shots, to strike and
kill with six, considering the expertness of seals
in ‘diving on the fire,’ is, I believe, also unprecedented;
and to cap all, that not one of the
six should have sunk when shot, is extraordinary
and unaccountable; for, as I have already said,
they sink when killed in the water quite as
often as they float, if not oftener. Anyhow, Mr
A—— had the rare good fortune to encounter a
splendid opportunity, and he made a splendid
use of it.</p>

<p>A good dog is a useful auxiliary to a seal-hunter;
but he requires a good deal of training
to learn his work. Very soon he acquires the
art of stalking; but most dogs at first are
apparently afraid to lay hold of a dead seal
floating in the water, and very commonly, when
sent off to fetch him ashore, simply attempt
to mount on him, and in consequence do harm
rather than good by helping to sink him. But
generally—not always, for some dogs we never
could train to do the right thing—we succeeded
in teaching them to retrieve. When we had
brought a seal home, we used to throw it over
the jetty or out of a boat with a stout cord
attached, and encourage the dog to fetch him.
Great praise was bestowed when he learned to
lay hold of a flipper and tow the selkie shoreward;
in this way, with a little patience and
perseverance, the dog soon came to learn what
was required; and many a seal was secured by
his help, which without it might inevitably have
been lost, for a seal shot in the water from the
shore, which they often were, was very generally
on the opposite side of an island or long promontory,
where a landing had been effected; and
it took many minutes before the boat could be
got round; and by that time, but for the dog,
the seal might have sunk.</p>

<p>We tried many breeds of dogs—Newfoundland,
Retriever, St Bernard, Rough water-dog,
and Collie; but after all, the best seal retriever
of the lot was a Collie. When he comprehended
what was wanted and how to do it, he did
it neatly and thoroughly. I well remember
the first seal I shot. I had landed on the
weather-side of a small island. A cautious
reconnoitring discovered a good-sized seal
‘lying up’ on a detached rock. Then I commenced
the stalking, closely followed by my
dog. But ere I could approach within range,
one of those seal-sentinels and provoking
tormentors of the seal-hunter, a herring gull,
set up his wild warning scream. The seal
perfectly understood what it meant, at once took
the alarm, plunged into the water, and disappeared.
I sprang to my feet, rushed down
along a little promontory, and then crouched
behind a big boulder, in hopes that selkie
would show his head above water and give me
a chance at him. And he did. Raising his head
and neck, he took a good look shoreward; but
seeing nothing to account for the gull’s persistent
screaming, he turned round, and raised his head
preparatory to a dive. I had him well and
steadily covered; now was my chance. I pulled
the trigger; no splash followed, which would have
meant a miss; but the <i>lioom</i>—that is, the smoothing
of the water by the flow of the oil—told that my
bullet had taken effect. ‘Fetch him, old dog!
fetch him!’ I cried. In an instant he plunged
into the sea and swam to the seal, which I could
see was floating. Neatly he dipped his head
under water, seized a hind flipper, turned it over
his neck, and towed him towards the shore.
Passing the rock on which I stood in his way
to the beach, he turned his eyes upwards for
the praise and encouragement I was not, it may
well be believed, backward to lavish on him.
Such a look it was! I shall never forget it,
instinct with the brightest intelligence, joy, pride,
triumph. Indeed, I don’t know whether he or
his master was proudest and happiest that day.
Alas, that our noble ‘humble friends’ should be
so short-lived!</p>

<p>I have not shot a great many seals. They are
not now, nor were they in my younger and
sporting days, so numerous as they were fifty
or sixty years ago, when but a very few persons
here and there owned a gun, which with scarcely
an exception was only the old regulation flintlock
musket. But since the invention of percussion
locks, and of the splendid rifles and
breech-loaders of the present day, and still more
since steamers and sailing-vessels have been constantly
plying amongst the islands, where formerly
they never were seen, the seals have not had so
peaceful a time of it; slaughter and persecution,
and the inroads of modern civilisation in general,
have greatly diminished their numbers; at least
they are not now so frequently met with in their
old haunts, from which it is probable most of
them have retired, to more inaccessible and therefore
safer quarters. These remarks apply only
to the common seal. The Great seal was never
very numerous anywhere, and there is not much
chance of his wild retreats being disturbed except
by an occasional hunter.</p>

<p>I have shot only three Great seals; but the
largest one certainly I ever saw, I might have
shot, but did not—dared not, I should say. Thus
it happened. It was at the Holms of Gloup—some
outlying rocks and skerries off the north
point of the island of Yell. There is a fine
hellyer here. According to the usual practice,
I had landed on an abutting point or promontory
at the outer entrance to the hellyer, and sent the
boat inwards. If a seal happens to be in the
hellyer, he plunges into the sea, swims out under
water, and very generally rises up at no great
distance, to see what is the cause of the disturbance
and noise—for seals, as I have said, are very
inquisitive as well as shy—and in this way the
sportsman in ambush often gets a capital shot.
As the boat went slowly inwards, the men kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">{509}</span>
shouting and peering into the darkness, all eyes
directed towards the inner beach, which was dimly
visible. Presently from my perch of some twenty
or thirty feet, I saw, in the clear water, what
they did not see, a rushing white figure coming
outwards under water. Then, not thirty yards
distant, the head and neck of an enormous
haff-fish<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> rose above the surface. For time enough
to have shot him five times over, he gazed at the
boat, the back of his head turned towards me,
and offering such a mark as I never had before
or since. I covered him with the sights; my
finger trembled on the trigger; I knew my weapon
would not fail me. I knew I could kill him
easily, and secure him too, even if he should
sink, for the water was clear and shallow. But,
as ill-fortune would have it, he was directly in
the line between me and the boat, and I did not
dare to fire. The boatmen never saw him, and
of course I could make no sign. So the great
ocean patriarch, having satisfied his curiosity,
quietly withdrew under water.</p>

<p>I shall conclude with one other adventure of
my seal-hunting experience. It was at the Neeps
off Gravaland, on the west side of Yell. Here
the coast-line is sinuous and precipitous, the cliffs
in many parts being very high; and here there
are many well-sheltered creeks, rather favourite
haunts of the tang-fish. A cautious survey discovered
twelve or twenty of them ‘lying up’ on
a few detached rocks in one of these creeks, and
of course, as usual, far beyond range from any
point on the top of the cliff. To get a chance
of a shot, it was necessary to scramble down to
the beach and out amongst the great boulders
left dry by the ebb-tide, a matter of no small
difficulty, and also danger. I was accompanied
by a young Englishman, who was very eager for
a shot. Retiring a little from the brow of the
cliff, we held a brief whispered consultation.
‘Nothing for it,’ I said, ‘but to get down. Will
you try it?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ he replied; ‘I dare not. I always get
giddy, looking down from great heights, and I
could not possibly attempt a precipice like that.
Do you really mean to venture?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly,’ I said; ‘nothing venture nothing
win.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well,’ rejoined he, ‘you’re to the manner
born, and I wish you luck.’</p>

<p>One can’t climb or descend a difficult precipice
with boots, so I discarded mine, carefully
charged my trusty old fowling-piece,
and commenced the descent, well out of view
of the seals. The task would have been no
easy one at any time; but cumbered as I was
with my fowling-piece, and obliged to double
and twist in all directions, to avoid being seen,
it was stalking under difficulties of no ordinary
magnitude. After infinite toil and circumspection,
I found myself about thirty feet from
the bottom; but farther I was utterly unable
to proceed without coming full in sight of
the seals, who were as yet unaware of the
proximity of danger. Continuing my downward
course, they soon caught sight of me, and one
after another quietly slipped off the rocks into
the water. I made my way to the beach, and
crept out as far as possible amongst the great
ebb-stones, behind one of which I crouched, in
hopes of getting a shot at a seal swimming, for
they kept bobbing up and down in the creek.
At last one fellow did give me a pretty good
chance, and I brought his gambols to a speedy
close. To strip and plunge into the sea was the
work of a minute. But before I reached him he
had sunk. This was very provoking. However,
nothing daunted, I returned on shore, retraced
my way up the cliff, and then across a long
stretch of barren moor, to the nearest fishermen’s
cottages at Whalfirth Voe. A boat was speedily
manned by three obliging young fellows, and
a pull of several miles brought us round to the
creek. Having borrowed two stout piltock rods,
I lashed them firmly together, and tied a ling hook
to the point, and thus extemporised a capital gaff.
We found the water not more than twelve or
fourteen feet deep, and quite clear. I knew the
exact spot where the seal had sunk; so we
soon discovered him lying on the bottom,
seeming not much larger than a good-sized cod,
owing, I suppose, to refraction. I speedily gaffed
him, and brought him to the surface. He proved
to be a splendid animal, five feet nine inches in
length, and very fat. The skin, a particularly
fine one, I presented to my English friend; and
the blubber was converted into oil, which kept
our dining-room lamp burning brightly during
many long nights of the succeeding winter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOME_SACRED_TREES">SOME SACRED TREES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are few things more impressive to the
thoughtful mind than the near contemplation of
tall and large trees in full foliage. They are
symbols of antiquity and endurance, yet also of
the changes consequent on a constant renewal.
Traditions gather naturally round an object which
witnesses the growth and disappearance of generations.
The memories of men long dead become
connected with them; and the rude imagination
pictures the souls of the departed as still lingering
in the familiar groves, and haunting the favourite
tree which sheltered them in the noonday
heat and from the fury of the sudden tempest.
Such fancies in untutored times naturally induced
veneration for the object which inspired them, and
such may have been the origin of tree-worship,
which has been a prevalent form of idolatry.</p>

<p>In the East, the greatest veneration is paid
to the Indian <i>Ficus religiosa</i>, the sacred and consecrated
fig-tree or peepul-tree, which is held
pre-eminently sacred by the Buddhists, and is
revered also by the Hindus, the birth of Vishnu
having occurred beneath its branches. It is the
Rarvasit, the tree of knowledge and wisdom, the
holy Bo-tree of the lamas of Tibet. It is met
with in most countries of South-eastern Asia;
but the descriptions of it in botanical handbooks
are confused and misleading. It is a
handsome tree, growing frequently to a great
height, an evergreen, which puts forth its flowers
in April, and the bark yields freely upon
incision an acrid milk containing a considerable
proportion of india-rubber. According to Balfour,
‘the leaves are heart-shaped, long, pointed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">{510}</span>
not unlike those of some poplars; and as the
footstalks are long and slender, the leaves
vibrate in the air like those of the aspen. It
was under this tree that Gautama slept, and
dreamed that his bed was the vast earth, and
the Himalaya Mountains his pillow, while his
left arm reached to the Eastern Ocean, his right
to the Western Ocean, and his feet to the great
South Sea.’ (Balfour’s <i>Cyclopædia of India</i>.)
This dream warned him that he was about to
become a Buddha; and when its prophecy was fulfilled,
he was again seated beneath the same tree.</p>

<p>In the year 250 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> a branch of this sacred
tree was sent to the ancient city of Amūrādhapōōra,
in the interior of Ceylon, together with
the collar-bone of Gautama, and his begging-dish
with other relics. Here it was planted, and was
known by the name of the Bo-tree. The highest
reverence was paid to it for two thousand years,
and it is to this day the chief object of worship
to the pilgrims who every year flock to the ruins
of this city. These ruins are of vast extent,
and abound in intricate and magnificent carvings.
‘An inclosure of three hundred and forty-five
feet in length, and two hundred and sixteen in
breadth, surrounds the court of the Bo-tree,
designated by Buddhists the great, famous, and
triumphant fig-tree.’ It is declared to be the
same tree sprung from the branch sent by Asoka
from Buddh-gyâ, and the amazing vigour and
longevity of these trees make the assertion within
the limits of the possible. ‘The city is in ruins,’
says Fergusson; ‘its great dagobas (sanctuaries
containing relics) have fallen into decay; its
monasteries have disappeared; but the great Bo-tree
still flourishes, according to the legend:
“Ever green, never growing, or decreasing, but
living on for ever for the delight and worship
of mankind.” There is probably no older idol
in the world, certainly none more venerated.’<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>A recent Indian periodical, describing the white
elephant purchased by Mr Barnum, states that,
under the terms of the deed of sale, the great
showman was required to swear ‘by the holy
and sacred Bo-tree’ that the animal, itself
reverenced in the highest degree, should receive
every kindness and consideration.</p>

<p>The next instance of a venerated tree is of a
still more astonishing kind. Tsong Kaba, the
founder of the Yellow Cap Lamas, who became
Buddha in the early part of the fifteenth century,
was endowed from his birth with miraculous
white hair. At the age of three years his head
was shaved, and the hair, which was fine, long,
and flowing, was thrown outside his parents’
tent. ‘From this hair there forthwith sprung
a tree, the wood of which dispensed an exquisite
perfume around, and each leaf of which bore,
engraved on its surface, a character in the sacred
language of Tibet.’ Whatever may be thought
of this legend, it is certain that the tree which
it is concerned with actually existed in the days
of the Abbé Huc, who visited it, and in whose
Travels it is circumstantially described. It is
situated at the foot of the mountain where Tsong
Kaba was born, near the lamasery or Buddhist
convent called Kounboum, which signifies the
‘Ten Thousand Images,’ and is a famous place
of pilgrimage.</p>

<p>‘This tree,’ says the abbé, ‘does exist; and we
had heard of it too often in our journey not to
feel somewhat eager to visit it. At the foot of
the mountain on which the lamasery stands is
a great square inclosure, formed by brick walls.
Upon entering this, we were able to examine at
leisure the marvellous tree. Our eyes were first
directed with earnest curiosity to the leaves; and
we were filled with an absolute consternation of
astonishment at finding that there were upon
each of the leaves well-formed Tibetan characters,
all of a green colour—some darker, some lighter
than the leaf itself. Our first impression was a
suspicion of fraud on the part of the lamas; but
after a minute examination of every detail, we
could not discover the least deception. The
characters all appeared to us portions of the
leaf itself, equally with its veins and nerves.
The position was not the same in all: in one
leaf, they would be at the top; in another, in
the middle; in a third, at the base, or side.
The younger leaves represented the characters
only in a partial state of formation. The bark
of the tree and of its branches, which resemble
that of the plane-tree, is also covered with these
characters. When you remove a piece of the
bark, the young bark under it exhibits the
indistinct outlines of characters in a germinating
state; and what is very singular, these new
characters are not unfrequently different from
those which they replace. We examined everything
with the closest attention, in order to
detect some trace of trickery; but we could
discern nothing of the sort. The tree of the
Ten Thousand Images seemed to be of great age.
Its trunk, which three men could scarcely
embrace with outstretched arms, is not more
than eight feet high; the branches spread out
in the shape of a plume of feathers, and are
extremely bushy; few of them are dead. The
leaves are always green; and the wood, which
is of a reddish tint, has an exquisite odour,
something like cinnamon. The lamas informed
us that in summer towards the eighth moon, the
tree produces large red flowers of a beautiful
character. Many attempts have been made in
various lamaseries of Tartary and Tibet to propagate
it by seeds and cuttings, but all these
attempts have been fruitless.</p>

<p>‘The Emperor Khang-hi, when upon a pilgrimage
to Kounboum, constructed at his own
private expense a dome of silver over the tree
of the Ten Thousand Images, and endowed the
lamasery with a yearly revenue for the support
of three hundred lamas.’ This tree is said to be
still in existence.</p>

<p>In Hunter’s <i>Annals of Rural Bengal</i>, there is
the following interesting instance of tree-worship.
‘Adjoining the Santal village is a grove of their
national tree’—the Sal (<i>Shorea robusta</i>)—‘which
they believe to be the favourite resort of all the
family gods (lares) of the little community. From
its silent gloom the bygone generations watch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">{511}</span>
their children playing their several parts in life.
Several times a year the whole hamlet, dressed
out in its showiest, repairs to the grove to do
honour to the <i>Lares Rurales</i> with music and
sacrifice. Men and women join hands, and
dancing in a large circle, chant songs in remembrance
of the original founder of the community,
who is venerated as the head of the village
pantheon. Goats, red cocks, and chickens are
sacrificed; and while some of the worshippers
are told off to cook the flesh for the coming
festival at great fires, the rest separate into families,
and dance round the particular trees which
they fancy their domestic lares chiefly haunt.’</p>

<p>Three principal deities are at this day worshipped
by the people of Dahomey: the serpent-god,
which Burton describes as a brown python,
streaked with white and yellow, of moderate
dimensions, and quite harmless. This is the
supreme god. ‘It has one thousand Danh-’si,
or snake-wives.’ These are maidens and married
women devoted to the service of the serpent.
The second deity ‘is represented by lofty and
beautiful trees, in the formation of which Dame
Nature seems to have expressed her greatest
art. They are prayed to and presented with
offerings in times of sickness, and especially of
fever. Those most revered are the Hun-’tin,
or acanthaceous silk-cotton, whose wives equal
those of the snake; and the Loko, the well-known
Edum, ordeal, or poison tree of the
West African coast. The latter numbers fewer
Loko-’si or Loko spouses. On the other hand,
it has its own fetich pottery, which may be
bought in every market.’ The god Hu, the
ocean, is the youngest of the three deities; he
is inferior both in power and age to the other
divinities, and his turbulence is held in check
by them.</p>

<p>The island of Ferro is the most westerly and
the smallest of the Canaries. Fresh water is
very scarce, and the moisture which falls from
the leaves of the linden-tree is said to be collected
to increase the supply. This seems to be
the only foundation for a wonderful story told
in Glass’s <i>History of the Canary Islands</i>, concerning
a ‘fountain-tree,’ which would certainly have
received divine honours of the highest kind from
all tree-worshippers. There grows, says the story,
in the middle of the island a tree, ‘called in
the language of the ancient inhabitants, Garse—that
is, sacred or holy tree—which constantly
distils from its leaves such a quantity of water
as is sufficient to furnish drink to every creature
in Ferro. It is situated about a league and a
half from the sea. Nobody knows of what species
it is, only that it is called Til. The circumference
of the trunk is about twelve spans, and
in height it is about forty spans. Its fruit
resembles the acorn, the leaves those of the
laurel; but they are larger, wider, and more
curved; they come forth in a perpetual succession,
so that the tree always remains green. On
the north side of the trunk are two large tanks.
Every morning a cloud of mist rises from the
sea, and rests upon the thick leaves and wide-spreading
branches, whence it distils in drops
during the remainder of the day. This tree
yields most water when the Levant or east winds
have prevailed, for by these winds only the
clouds are drawn from the sea. A person lives
on the spot, who is appointed to take care of
the tree and its water, and is allowed a house
to live in and a certain salary.’</p>

<p>The story is evidently told in good faith; and
the power of condensing mist is possessed by
various species of trees. The Garse, moreover,
has been described by more than one traveller.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while tree-worship is, of course,
essentially pagan, innumerable superstitions concerning
trees have prevailed in Christian countries,
notably in England. They are now almost
extinct; but the traveller in remote country-places
might still meet with some of those strange
instances recorded in Brand’s <i>Antiquities</i> and in
the <i>Fragments</i> of Edward Moor.</p>

</div>
<p class="ph3">AN AUTUMN REVERIE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dreamy hush of a warm autumn noon,
broken only by the sweet murmurous sound of
the falling water as it leaps from its shining
pebbled shallows into the rock-encompassed linn.
What could give more peace and quiet delight
than this? Let us sit for one brief half-hour
under the fresh green hazels and drink in the
varied charms of sight and sound. We are ‘far
from the madding crowd,’ and have left all
care leagues behind. Let us rest on this
mossy bank in the delight of dreamy ease,
with the delicious fragrance of the wild
thyme wafted to us on the wing of the
gentle breeze. We are here seeking rest, and
that sweet dreamy pleasure which a mind can
get when it is in the delicious equipoise that
repose and the beauties of nature can bring.
The stream’s melodious wanderings in this sunny
hour are of more importance to us than all
the anxious worldly sounds of a city’s din;
and the glowing petals of that wild red rose
wooing its own shadow in the stream are
better far to our eyes in our present mood than
any of the exquisite studies of Salvator Rosa
or Claude Lorraine. What wealth of light and
shadow is given to us in the far-stretching
umbrageous vista! Never had cathedral aisles
more perfect and graceful roof, or more radiant
lights from painted windows; and is not the
music here of stream and hazel-haunting warblers
sweeter and more heart-inspiring than the
organ’s swell? The interlacing branches through
which the filtered sunlight comes, rendered in
flashes of green and gold, are better than the
Gothic roof of cathedral aisle or dome; and
the eerie cry of the curlew commends itself
more to our soul—in the midst of heather and
mountains as we are—than would the richest
chorus of human song.</p>

<p>This is not the time or place for preaching
or moralising; but is it out of place for us to
consider in this delectable hour the exquisite
delight that we poor unworthy souls get by
an intense reverence for the harmonies that
nature has for us! This glen, these sheltering
hazels, this melodious mountain rill, are all
our own. For the time we are the possessors
of these green grottos and flashing waves and
bird-notes, which exceed in excellence anything
that kings’ palaces can give.</p>

<p>Every rustle of the breeze turns over for us
a fresh leaf of Nature’s wondrous, inexhaustible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">{512}</span>
book; and the flash of emerald from the kingfisher’s
breast, or the glorious note from the
blackbird’s mellow throat, gives us sudden and
bright revelations of sweetness and joy, that we
can call up with a lingering delight and tenderness
of feeling when we are far away. Up
the bed of the glistening stream there, at a
perfect artistic distance, are the silent shadowy
rocks, overlooking and guarding the deep and
sullen linn, and working out Nature’s will
with a quiet watchfulness, and with a changeless
solemnity and patience. And see! right
above the sombre linn there are rainbow-fringed
cloudlets of spray, brought down by the laughing
stream, that comes with soothing unobtrusive din
over its rocky ledges.</p>

<p>That sound of falling waters is like a lullaby,
and contains in it more of the hush of rest than
anything else in nature.</p>

<p>What a history this mountain stream must
have had in all the seasons and the centuries!
and how many hearts has it not gladdened in its
lights and shadows and silvery song! Its waters
have chiselled these overhanging rocks into a stern
beauty, and those boulders have been moulded
by them into a soft symmetry and grace. Its
changes are like the mutations that belong to
human life, now the roar of the torrent, and now
the deep calm of the clear crystalline pool. The
sportive trout has long leaped from the quiet
breast of its limpid shallows, and its woodlands
have resounded to the song of the mavis
and blackbird. The swallows that have passed
their winter amid the slopes of Carmel, the
groves of Sharon, or the gardens of Damascus,
may be those that are now skimming over the
sunlit pools there in the hush of this noontide
hour. But their aërial and graceful flight is
as pleasing here to us poor rest-seeking pilgrims
as ever it was to the eye of vizier or khan;
and the cottage eaves in this glen echo the
twitter to human ears as deliciously as do the
frescoed piazzas of Athens, Venice, or Rome.</p>

<p>What a temple is here for the worship, with
reverent spirit, with silent tongue, of the One
who made and loveth all! Ferns and flowers,
birds and wandering bees, sunshine and singing
waters! What lessons of tenderness, natural piety,
and reverence may we not get here! Yon shaft
of sunlight, filtered through the hazels, striking
the stream, and lighting its still bosom with
emerald and gold, brings before us some of the
finest lines of <i>Lycidas</i>, that peerless poem of the
lights and shadows and music of Arcadia.</p>

<p>All around us, the brightness that fills the
spirit, the deep shadows beneath scaur and tree,
the sound of bleating upon the hills, and the
melody of waters dashing past boulders or rolling
with an onward, free, and joyous music over
pebbled beds, lead us alike to reverence and
gratitude. Nature is a gentle, sweet, and loving
teacher. We shall never touch the hem of her
garment in vain. She giveth us grace and
sympathy and love.</p>

<p>But we must leave our bosky dell in the
midst of this Highland glen. We can carry
away, however, memories from it that shall be
always our own. The indescribable yet fascinating
music of the waters falling into the linn
yonder is ours for ever now; so is the rock
there, cushioned with the tender green moss,
that moss that comes in silence, and lays its
gentle covering mantle over the mounds of our
beloved dead. There, too, a few yards from us,
is a still pool which might remain for ever in
one’s memory. How the shadows are reflected
from the flowers! Here we have the fable of
Narcissus told us again in this Highland dell.
But that flower near us droops—it is almost
touching its shadow: they have been wooing each
other long. By-and-by they will clasp each other,
and wooed and wooer will float away. But it
is autumn, and flowers must wither and die.
When our autumn departure cometh, may our
passing away be as calm!</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
